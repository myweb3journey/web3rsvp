# A Web 3.0 RSVP dApp 

This is essentially a web3-native Eventbrite, except attendees need to deposit ETH to RSVP and will get it back upon them checking in at the event.

# This event management and creation dapp is built with this stack on Ethereum using Solidity:

- Filecoin & IPFS
- The Graph
- Radicle
- Infura
- Polygon
- Lens

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
